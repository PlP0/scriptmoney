Hello World - 

Today we're going to dive into the Occult - which is knowledge held by few and hidden from sight of the masses 

Most people will go through their entire lifes completely oblivous that such knowledge even exists -

Thus never lifting the veil thats been placed over their eyes to blind them from the truth - that they're slaves Neo, Wake up - The matrix is everywhere

you were born into a pre-fabricated reality - Go to school - Get a job - Pay taxes - Save Money - Buy a house because its an asset -

Get out of debt - and invest in the stock market - Thats hipnosis going through your brain - its slave programming - because the slaves of the new age

are not in chains, but in debt - the matrix is a system neo guarded by the tyrants greatest weapon - ignorance - and that system is our enemy - 

when you look around what do you see?  business men, teachers, lawyers, carpenters, all thinking that they earn for themselves - 

believing the money they use is a tool of trade not of control - you have to understand that most of these people are not ready to see it - 

many of them are so invested - so hopelessly dependent on the system that they would fight to protect it - The brain is mother natures super computer 

and your conscious is the software its running - Your thoughts are mere programs - So you must be wary with what you consume - 

if you're not careful - you can end up with malicious software running on your mind - As former Emperor of Rhome Marcus Aurelious once said 

"The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts: therefore, guard accordingly... the things yoyu think about determine the 

quality of your mind - your soul takes on the color of your thoughts" So make sure you're the only one doing the programming - Don't 

install viruses - You achieve this through critical thinking - Question EVERYTHING - and explore EVERY possible avenue you can imagine in your mind - 

like a game of chess - Because eventhough we're no longer in the wild sleeping among the trees - We're still subject to different kinds of predators - 

not everyone doing the programming has your best intentions in mind - you don't want to be a pawn used to manifest others dreams - 

Critical Thinking is your antivirus - filter everything through your own best judgement - don't accept any information as truth, just entertain it in your 

head, as you gather more knowledge the truth will unveil itself - but don't cling to truth or knowledge - for Socrates, the wisest man to have ever 

live said "I am the wisest man alive, for I know one thing, and that is that I know nothing" - be open to the possibility that everything you know is wrong - 

because the more you know, the more you know you don't know - As Bruce Lee said - "be like water" - you don't want your brain to be hard as concrete 

to the point you can't absorb new ideas - learn to let go of a mindset that no longer suits you - and adopt mindsets that help you grow - 

learn to unlearn and relearn - contrary to what indoctrination camps condition you to believe, I mean jails or schools, its ok to make mistakes they're 

the fuel of your growth - the successful among us sacrifice - to be smart you don't need to be a walking encyclopedia - you just need to have 

a powerful mindset that will get you through any obstacle - so its not about how much you know, but how you think that matters -

So have you ever asked yourself - what is money ?  Do you know ?  Do you really know?

Because most people don't - and spend their entire lifes pursuing these magical pieces of papers without ever knowing what it even is!

Its proposterous! Its like, everyone knows how to drive a car but only a few know how it works under the hood - and the same can be said

for money - everyone knows how to spend it but no body understands what it is - I've ran my own experiments where I ask people

"What is money?" and I get different answers ranging from "its a piece of paper" to "oh its the source of all evil" - however no one seems to get it right

The responses I get are descriptions of money - but don't answer the fundamental question - what is money? - in case you didn't know, all money is - is a database -

a tool humans created for the purpose of enabling trade amongst each other - Money is as old as civilization itself - Back when we were still 

hunters and gatherers - living in tribes and villages - barter was cash - debts and credits were kept in the head as a mental ledger -  



Money's value starts in the mind 

whoms value derives from indoctrination - I say indoctrination because money stopped being real in 1971 when President Nixon took

the U.S. Dollar off the Gold Standard.  These pieces of papers aren't backed by anything anymore - their value comes solely from the government

who calls it consumer purchasing power. 


For starters, most people don't even know that the federal reserve is a private institution - in other words, its not even federal

And it doesn't have any reserves either.  Its a giant ponzi scheme that will inevitably collapse one day - and the fed knows this

They're already working on the next generation of currency, when current one collapses - a new one will rise from the Ashes like a PHEONIX from the tower of babel



So what is money and Why is everything so damn expensive when I go grocery shopping!





It's imperative we all learn what crypto currencies are.  As John Whacked McAfee once said "The pandoras box that has been open, you will never get that idea back in the box". <video is john mcafee crypto currency is coming is like the pandoras box>    As a matter
of fact  if you're from the U.S> here's your government telling you the same thing -  U.S. Treasurer of the United States Rosie Rios.  <play rosie rios video>  She even brags about her name being on over 90% of the U.S. Dollars in existence. Yeah those
pieces of paper we all work for, AND SHE'S TELLING YOU THIS IS THE FUTURE

Crypto is a double edge sword that can empower or enslave the population! So it is extremely important we all teach one another and learn about this incredible new technology.  All of us are playing
an important role in creating a better world.  If you want to change the world, start with yourself!  Because you are the world!  Always have an open mind!  For Scientists are nothing more
than normal individuals who are no better than you arguing about truth.  Humans are but biological robots nature gave rise to, we're all a bunch of smart robots with different data sets.  And truth exists, its math! And math doesn't lie.  It can't, it has no emotions.  So before we even tackle what crypto currencies are, we must first learn what money is to begin with.  You can't appreciate crypto currencies until you see the flaws of the current financial system of the world, once you see the flaws in the dollar, 
theres no going back! You're going to be flocking to liquidate everything to stack crypto like all the enligthen nerds.  

So what is money? 
Money is just a database of value, its a technology! We use it to trade wealth, and to keep track of wealth.  The pieces of paper or digital numbers we see in our bank accounts are the medium of exchange we use in the database.  Money - or the medium of exchange -  has taken many shapes and forms throughout history! - For example The ancient Mayans used cacao beans—the principal ingredient in chocolate—as a currency, according to a study published in the journal Economic Anthropology!
THAT WAS THEIR MONEY!!!  And in Asia they used RICE. 
Humans eventually transitioned from trading barter to Raw Metals such as Gold and Silver, which later evolved to Coins because
who their right mind wants to be carrying around huge blocks of Metal, they're heavy as hell.  Heck didn't levi even invent the JEANS because metal was too
heavy? (the pieces of gold)  Then Those coins also transformed.  Next came fiat currencies! The pieces of paper we all know and love! Just 
kidding not love, just know and use. Okay so allow me to explain, what are these pieces of paper?  Well originally these pieces of papers
were supposed to be backed by something! Such as precious metals! Like Gold and Silver!  Ya'll know how when you travel to different countries they have
currency exchanges, or shops that exchange your dollars for their native currency?  For example if you're from the U.S. and you travel to Mexico,
and you take your pieces of paper over there, you can go to currency exchange shop that will trade your dollars for mexican pesos!  In the past, these kinds of exchanges
existed!  But for the precious metals! And that was the birth of Banks!  And you would be able to go cash out your pieces of paper
for metals and vice versa.  They even existed here in the U.S.!  As a matter of fact there used to be multiple currencies here in the U.S.!
Until the federal reserve act passed.  Back in te day, the U.S. Dollar used to be backed by Gold.  The Gold standard had its purpose!  It was important, because it instilled discipline
in government spending.  Once you remove the scarcity aspect of money, governments can fund whatever the fuck they want! And pave way for <drum roll>
inflation! It happened in Venezuela and now they're communist:) 

Ayways lets backtrack a bit.  What the hell is the dollar?  And what in the world is the federal reserve?  Well the Federal Reserve
is actually a private bank!  Owned by a private family!  Like yourself and your family! Except its not your family.  Go ahead and pause the video and meditate on that thought for a bit.  The 
word Federal is only added to create an illusion.  An illusion we all believe.  Trust me there is nothing Federal or Reserve about the
Federal Reserve.  The U.S. Dollar today is no longer backed by anything.  We Trust In GOD.  So what is the Dollar?  The Dollar is what you call
a fiat currency.  So add that new word to your mind to your vocabulary!  Fiat Currencies.  Government issued currencies are called Fiat Currencies.

After World War 2 ended, the whole world got together to set up the new world order.  Prior to World War 2, countries
would move the BIG PIECES OF METALS around the world for payments.  Holy shit that is heavy.  After World War 2 the nations of the world got together and established The Bretton Woods Agreement a system through which a fixed currency exchange rate could be created using gold as the universal standard. The agreement involved representatives from 44 nations and brought about the creation of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.  The Bretton Woods Agreement and System created a collective international currency exchange regime that lasted from the mid-1940s to the early 1970s. 
The Bretton Woods System required a currency peg to the U.S. dollar which was in turn pegged to the price of gold.
Countries agreed to the Bretton Woods Agreement because back then, the Dollar was just as good as Gold! For it was backed by gold! However the U.S. Government started printing more money than it had gold reserves to back it, countries around the world picked up on this so they started demanding for their gold back and began exchanging their dollars for gold!  


 But then in 1971 a historical event happened. President Richard Nixon declared an emergency "temporary" hault in the exchange of dollars for gold.  A Temporary hault that is still active today.  And since then the money printing machine has gone ballistic. <show fed printing money gif here>  Under the current monetary system All money is created as debt.  
The U.S. Government borrows it from the Federal Reserve - and promises to pay it back with interest. The only problem is, 
lets imagine theres only $2 dollars in the world.  Only those $2 dollars exist in the world thats it.  And lets say I loan you the only two dollars that exist in the world, and you promise to pay them back to me with interest!  cmon who are you fooling how are you going to pay me back with interest if theres only 2 dollars in existence!  Where are you going to get another dollar to pay me back the interest?


The answer is YOU CANT! You have to borrow MORE!  In order to pay back the initial loan.  Its literally a ponzi scheme because you can never pay it off.  Its a system that requires you to get deeper and deeper in to debt!

But its okay I guess, if a ponzi scheme is what it took to get humanity where it is today.  
Its okay becase A GOLDEN AGE is upon us!  And this golden will be the direct result of the adoption of DECENTRALIZED distributed ledger technologies!  So Add that word to your vocabulary too! Distributed Ledger Technology, or DLT for short.  DLT is the core technology behind Crypto Currencies.  


<left off here> 

Okay so now that we know what money is

What the hell are crypto currencies? Well first you need to stop thinking of it as simply digital money, because although it is, it is also much more than just digital money!  Its the tokenization of
of EVERYTHING.  By tokenization I mean, putting it on the Distributed Ledger.  The world runs on middle men, and crypto will wipe them out!  And don't worry thats not a bad thing.  
Infact its a VERY good thing for it'll allow people to directly transact with one another! Without the need of middle men.  We all use these middle men everyday!  Who are these middle
men i'm talking about?  Well its THE BANKS! You every time you swipe your card middle men are taking care of business.  And they take a cut of the transaction.  With crypto people will
be able to transact directly with one another withotu the need of middle men! For all trust will lie on the computers and open source programming for the world to see.  Not only that
people will be transacting much more than just money!  For example, you'll be able to tokenize your home! Put it on a distributed ledger and have it be represented by an NFT.  Add that word to your
vocabulary too, NFTs, or none fungible tokens.  NFT's will be much more than just monkey JPEGs.  They can represent your house, your car, your diploma, your ID.  
And since its all on blockchain, its you can verify authenticity! Meaning you wouldn't be able to fake or duplicate the NFT token that represents ownership of ___.(your house your jpeg).
NFT's are very a very exciting technology.  Trust me these are just the tip of the ice berge.  NFT's will also replace all the call of duty, minecraft, and fortnite skins!  Meaning
for the first time ever YOU'LL BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY OWN your digital items!  Have ya'll ever tried the virtual reality?  Virtual real estate is coming and it will be a thing!  
And to purchase all these digital items you'll require crypto currencies.  New markets will emerge!  Despite how terrible the economy might be looking right now
We'll rebound! To new all time highs of human achievement!  You'll see!  Distributed Ledger Technologies will take the world by storm!  Its like the beginning of the internet
all over again!  Because thats exactly what it is.  A whole new internet.  

So how does the technology behind crypto currencies work?  Well at its core its a distributed ledger.  So what exactly is a distributed ledger?
We humans tend to over think things.  Guys crypto isn't as complicated as you may think.  Don't lie to yourselves saying you can't understand it
You can you're just holding yourself back, change your mentality!  Nothing is impossible to learn!  For knowledge is finite.  Again what is a distributed ledger?  Well what is a ledger?
A ledger is like a book that keeps track of all transactions.  It is the database of value that I was talking about.  
Okay so what is a bank?  Open up your bank account on your phone and scroll through all your transactions.  The transactions you're scrolling through
is a digital ledger of the banks!  It is owned and controlled by the banks.  So crypto is just a bank! That ANYONE with access to the internet can access.  
The difference between a bank and a crypto currencie is that the Banks move Dollars and Crypto Currencies move Digital Assets.
Look we have smart phones, smart watches, smart cars, smart homes but no smart money?  Oh wait we do!  Its already manifested into our reality!
Its crypto! Lets get back to how it works.  Each crypto currency has its own protocol - in other words it's own way of doing things.  Since we've all heard of Bitcoin lets explore their protocol.
 


I know we've all heard the phrase "bitcoin is digital gold".  Well i'm here to tell you that Constellation Networks $DAG
is digital oil!  What do I mean by digital oil?  Well  DATA is the new oil in the digital age right?  Well $DAG is the tokenization of DATA.   






What are crypto currencies?
So you're telling me we have smart phones smart televisions smart homes smart toasters
but no smart money?
oh wait we do its ALREADY HEREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
A lot of people think its just money, and it is but its much more than just money
Its the tokenization of everything
Well what does tokenization mean? How can you tell the difference between a crypto currency and a token? 
Already these are new vocabulary words that you need to add to your mind
If you know absolutely nothing about crypto but you want to learn and want to know what the hype is all about
then 


Flaws of Money

Bitcoin

Alt Coins
Constellation is the new internet


I know a lot of people say that say "oh I wish I knew about bitcoin before it was big" 
They feel like they missed the train, That its too late to start investing
Well I'm here to remind everyone that THIS IS the beginning 
Some of the trains are still in the station but its not waiting
on anyone its going to take off when it takes off
The universe doesn't care about your thoughts feelings or emotions.  





Crypto Currenies are networks that work together to maintain a distributed ledger 
until now there had never been anything permanent about the internet.
