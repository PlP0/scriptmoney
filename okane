the mind once enlightened cannot again become dark - thomas paine




mind control is real

quote from tesla and that other quote (look through screenshots/pictures saved)

All we really are is awareness- free will is an illusion -  

free will is an illusion - life is like a dream - we're just spectators we don't control anything its all chemical reactions cause and effect
maybe life is just a game dont take it so serously

moment you're born you become another number in the matrix you're given race religion ethnicity etc. labels to create illusion of seperation 

but though free to think and act we are held toether like stars in the firmament with ties inseparable. these ties cannot be seen but we can feel them


The universe is infinite - bubt the amount of knowledge that exists is finite - the universe is composed of the same forces of nature

everywhere - Therefore you can learn and master any skill - theres only so much to learn to learn in any branch of the tree of knowledge - 

you can manifest your dreams into reality by becoming obssessed with your goals - put in the work - do the research - and never give up - I've never met someone 

whose very obssessed about going to the gym and living a healthy life style be out of shape - you learn to tame reality by learning how the universe works - 

learn that everything is math - the world knows many religions but nature knows one truth - taming reality is magic and we're the sorcerers - We are the 


creators and the universe is our canvas - maybe we are the gods and a species with amnesia searching everywhere but inwards 

for a mysterious supreme being - they say theres a god that sees everything you do - and don't you see everything you do? Perhaps thats what the egyptions 

meant when they wrote "The Kingdom of Heaven is within you; and whosoever shall know himself shall find it".  Closely enough - in the bible - which was

written thousands of years later - you'll find "The Kingdom of God is within you." - Christ (Luke 17:21).  And it makes sense - you are the universe

you eat an apple you become the apple - you are what you eat - life is nothing but chemical reactions - and the universe is a soup of chemicals - 

particles are mostly empty space - at its core everything is just energy - vibrations and ripples through space - don't get me wrong though - 

there are still mysteries left unanswered - many of which may never be solved - 

like why couldn't there just be nothing?  have you ever tried imagining what the world would be like if there was nothing?  a pitch black

dark universe is not nothing thats something - or another question I have is - if the universe is energy and energy can't be created or destroyed it can

only evolve - then that implies the universe has always existed - why has it always existed? i understand the forced of nature give rise to the universe

but why do these forces of nature even exist? 

so learn to identify the things you've got control over and the things

you do not - although you can manipulate people

quantum mechanics particles position isn't determined until observed and is in a state of super position

you cannot fully control other people - the only thing you can truly control is your own mind -  

learn to identify things you can and cannot change - you cannot control others only yourself

reality exists in the mind - reality is a dream - if you couldn't fail how far would you go - touch the boat

you are the unniverse you're made of universe you eat the apple you become the apple - you are god - ancient knowledge

the slave mind wants only to be ruled, it thinks first to become an employee instead of an employer, it can not create opportunities
for itself this is why most would work for companies until death yet wont start their own. the free mind builds with whatever material 
available and changes its environment it does not wait for change to occur it creates the change. the free mind needs no boss, employer,
director nor master because it is not enslaved

================================================================================================================================
Hello World - 

Today we're going to dive into the Occult - which is knowledge held by few - hidden from sight of the masses 

Most humans will go through their entire lifes completely oblivous that such knowledge even exists -

Thus never lifting the veil thats been placed over their eyes to blind them from the truth - that they're slaves Neo - Wake up -

The matrix is everywhere - You were born into a pre fabricated reality - As soon as you're born you are given a name, a religion, a nationality, a race

a social security number to identify you - just another number in the matrix - As a baby you have a built in natural instinct to trust your parents for 

survival - we label them as authority figures - and by the age of 4 you're placed in a government indoctrination camp where you're presented with a new authority 

figure - Teacher - A Puppet whose strings are pulled by the government to tell you what to think, what exists, what doesn't, whats real

what isn't, deliberately sculpting your perception of reality - But what is real? How do you define 'real'? If you're talking about what you can feel, what you 

can smell, what you can taste and see, then 'real' is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain - and senses can be deceived - 

The eye of horus is made up of six symbols - each representing our senses - smell, sight, hearing, taste, touch, and thought.  In the ancient vedic system 

thought is considered to be a sense - received simultaneously as sensations or expereinces on the body and arise from the same

vibratory source - thinking is simply a tool - one of six senses - but we have elevated into such a high status that we identify ourselves with

our thoughts - the fact that we do not recognize thinking as one of the six senses is very significant - we are so immerse in thought that trying to explain

thought as a sense is like telling a fish about water - water what water? - The truth is, everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact - and everything

we see is a perspective - not truth. 

***************** video about reality being an opinion ?  ************************** check insta

We should be teaching children how to think - not what to think.  Schools serve to condition people to become safe law abiding - government trusting citizens. They 

extrude creativity and critical thinking - discourage uniqueness and out of the box thinking - they don't want you to think for yourself

During World War 2 Nazi Germany was interested in preparing young children for war so Hitler created The Hitler Youth Group to teach young children how to 

become obedient soilders - similarly our education system pumps out obedient workers afraid of taking risk programmed to Go to school - Get a job - Pay taxes - 

Save Money - Buy a house because its an asset - Get out of debt - and invest in the stock market - its hipnosis going through your brain - 

The aim of public education is not to spread enlightenment at all, it is simply to reduce as many individuals as possible to the same safe level,

to breed and train a standardized citizenry, to put down dissent and originality.  John D Rockefeller - who created our modern education system

literally said - "I don't want a nation of thinkers, I want a nation of workers."  When the entirety of your earnings are exhausted on 

food and shelter, your labors are no longer viewed as an opportunity for economic advancement, but rather as an act of self-preservation.  

In the real world that's called ... Slavery - this is going to sound a bit deranged - but one day while this lovely man was imagining what the perfect prison

would be like - you know - casually / typical - he reached the conclussion that not only would you need consistent surveillance of your prisoners - 

a Panopticon - you'd also need to implement a rigid routine in which every second of the day is full of activities - one hour to eat one hour to

excercise one hour to go to sleep - you'd need to keep prisoners busy - don't spare them a second free to think - because the time they spend eating, working out,

and sleeping is time they aren't commiting crimes or planning an escape - look at it this way  - you can only have one thought at a time - and if the mind is 

always occupied - then you'll never plan an escape - this is why the Roman Poet Juvinal wrote "Give them bread and circuses - and they will never revolt"

Look the evil isn't in the bread and circuses per se, but in the willingness of the people to sell their rights as free men for full bellies and the excitement

of the games which serves to distract them from the other human hungers which bread and circuses can never appease - These principles of vigilence and control 

can be applied at larger scales - why stop at a jail when you can apply them to schools, hospitals, businesses, society - as a matter of fact you can have

a whole Panopticon country. Wouldn't that be terrible ? Look i'm not a criminal, I don't need anyone to control my time to stop me from commiting crimes -

but I do commit other activities of which I don't feel very proud of which I would like to change for more significant ones 

you might not be a criminal - but you do have a routine thats determined by your relationship and obligations to other people 

you wake up early so you don't have to deal with a congested highway or a packed metro - and go to work where they give you an hour to feed your self and continue 

working - and then you get home and make the most out of every second of freedom life allows you  - and the following day you do everything all over again 

You didn't determine this routine - but the circumstances under which you exist 

In society its very easy to chose the personality that the culture you habit offers you - to become what is expected of you - and your discrepancy between

you and the world disappears - and with it the fear of solitude and importance - you can become an automaton - or an NPC - a None Playable Character

- like the background characters in movies or video games whose only purpose is to exist - identical to millions of

NPCs at your surrounding  - free of all anxiety and uncertainty - but the price to pay is higly expensive - you must quit being your self 

The slaves of the new age are not in chains, but in debt - slaves to their impulses - mindless consumers - True freedom is DISCIPLINE - the matrix is a system neo - 

that system is our enemy - guarded by the unenlightened fools around you. It is in the interest of tyrants to reduce the people to ignorance and vice.  

For they cannot live in any country where virtue and knowledge prevail - when you look around what do you see?  business men, teachers, lawyers, carpenters, 

all thinking that they earn for themselves - believing the money they use is a tool of trade not of control - you have to understand that most of these people 

are not ready to see it - many of them are so invested - so hopelessly dependent on the system that they would fight to protect it -

Ignorance has always been the weapon of tyrants - Enlightenment the salvation of the free. The brain is mother natures super computer 

and your conscious is the software its running - Your thoughts are mere programs - So you must be wary with what you consume - 

if you're not careful - you could end up with malicious software running in your head - which will affect your life - As former 

Emperor of Rhome Marcus Aurelious once said "The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts: 

therefore, guard accordingly... the things you think about determine the quality of your mind - your soul takes on the color of your thoughts" 

So make sure you're the only one doing the programming and repel viruses - You achieve this through critical thinking - Question EVERYTHING - 

and explore EVERY possible avenue you can imagine in your mind - like a game of chess - Because eventhough we're no longer sleeping in the wild 

among the trees - We're still subject to predators - Guised as Governments, Businesses, Corporations, Institutions, The Mainstream Media, 

Influencers - not everyone doing the programming has your best intentions in mind - you don't want to be a pawn used to manifest the dreams of others - 

Critical Thinking is your antivirus - filter everything through your own best judgement - don't immediately accept any information as truth, just entertain it in 

in your mind - it is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought wihout accepting it - and as you collect more knowledge the truth will unveil 

itself - but don't cling to truth or knowledge - For Socrates, the wisest man to have ever lived said "I am the wisest man alive, for I know one thing, and that 

is that I know nothing" - be open to the possibility that everything you know is wrong - because the more you know, the more you know you don't know - 

Only fools know everything -  As Bruce Lee said - "be water my friend" - don't turn your brain hard as concrete to the point you can't absorb any new ideas - 

listen more than you speak - According to plato - “Wise men speak because they have something to say; Fools speak because they have to say something” - So 

when someone is speaking to you - learn to be in the present - shut the mind off and focus - tune into the conversation - you can learn something from the speaker - 

because every action and every word that comes out of the speakers mouth originates as a thought in the brain - so it gives you a glimpse into the workings of 

their minds and the data they hodl - if you're just eagerly waiting for the speaker to shut up so you can say something you already know - you're not listening, 

therefore you will miss an opportunity to learn something from the speaker - remember you can only truly focus on one thing at a time efficiently - So be humble - 

you can learn something from everyone - humans are gods robots and everything we know exists as data mind in our minds - When we go to sleep the brain stores 

new information and gets rid of toxic waste. Nerve cells communicate and reorganize, which supports healthy brain function. Neurons in the brain form connections 

that store all the knowledge and memories that create the illusion of you - So everything you learn literally becomes a part of you as neuro connections your brain - 

This is why people get upset when their beliefs are challenged with new information that contradicts what they believe - A mental conflict occurs that activates 

areas of the brain involved in personal identity and emotional response to threats.  The brain's alarms go off when a person feels threatened on a deeply personal 

and emotional level causing them to shut down and disregard any rational evidence that contradicts what they previously regarded as 'truth'.  However truth is not 

what you want it to be; it is what it is; you must bend to its power or live a lie.  Therefore you must learn to let go of mindsets that no longer suit you - and 

adopt new ideologys that help you grow - learn to unlearn and relearn - The matrix will program you to think its ok getting $100k into debt for a degree that 

won't pay itself back - and you believe it because its encouraged by your parents and teachers - figures of authority who should know what they're talking about 

right? Look if you can't think - I can't help you - the truth is that the Matrix pulling the strings of the people around you - 

friends and family tend to morph into Agent Smith to discourage you from taking risk, investing, or starting a business

This is because society needs slaves to function - and it also keeps potentially dangerous people from doing crime by giving them a noble goal

to pursuit - to be a good law abiding member of society - Just as animals hunt for their meal everyday - humans must work to put food on the table -

someone still needs to hunt and create stuff for us to trade - Otherwise society we wouldn't have a society - How would we feed people without farmers?  

Who would build the roads and buildings without workers? We work to create value and that forms a society for people to trade goods and services

Contrary to what indoctrination camps, schools or jails conditioned you to believe - its ok to make mistakes 

they're the fuel for growth - The successful among us sacrifice and bargain with the future - A winner is just an experienced loser.

You don't need to be a walking encyclopedia to be smart - you just need a powerful mindset that will get you through anything - its not about how much you know, 

but how you think that matters - The Law of Attraction states that "What you think starts a vibration that influences how you feel, impacts what you attract and 

creates your reality - so choose your thoughts wisely!" Why would you have negative thoughts and program your own brain to be against you?  As Elon Musk says,

"I'd rather be optimistic and wrong than pessimistic and right" - Having a pessimistic mindset because "you're just being realistic" doesn't make you  

smarter than everyone else, it just makes people dislike you - no one likes pessimistic people - According to the buddha - All that we are is the result of what we 

thought - the mind is everything - what we think we become.  So if you correct your mind the rest will fall into place.  Watch your thoughts - they become words

Watch your words - they become actions - watch your actions - they become habits - Watch your habits - they become your character 

Watch your Character - it becomes your destiny - Not-knowing is true knowledge.  Presuming to know is a disease.  First realize that you are sick,

then you can move towards health - Everybody is a genius.  But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree it will live its whole life believing

that it is stupid.

Anyways have you ever asked yourself - what is money ?  Do you know ?  Do you really know?

Because most people don't - and spend their entire lifes pursuing these magical pieces of papers without ever knowing what they even are!

Its proposterous! Its like, everyone knows how to drive a car but only a few know how it works under the hood - and the same can be said

for money - everyone knows how to spend money but no body understands what it is - If you were a NASCAR racer - wouldn't you want to know how

the car works under the hood so you can best modify your vehicle for the ultimate performance? - So for everyone chasing money - wouldn't it be wise for you 

to understand how money works to maximise your cash flow ? - I've ran some experiments of my own asking people 

"What is money?" and the answers I get range from "oh its a piece of paper" to "its the source of all evil" - however no one seems to get it right

The responses I get are describing functions of money - but don't answer the fundamental question - what is money? - in case you didn't know, 

all money is - is a database - a tool humans created for the purpose of enabling trade amongst each other - Money is actually older than civilization itself - 

Money can be described as something valuable we use to trade value - For example 

Primates, like the bonobos, are known to use sex as a form of currency.  Female bonobos trade sex for food and obtain a males favors.

Back when we were still hunters and gatherers - living in tribes and villages - debts and credits were kept in the head as a mental ledger -

If you don't know, a ledger is a complete record of a company's transactions over a period of time, documenting changes to assets, liabilities, equity, 

expenses and revenue.  Back then, barter was cash - for instance - someone would give you their daughter in exchange for some cows - or some pigs for some chickens - 

food for raw materials - when trading outside tribal villages people needed something scalable that everyone agreed had value - 

So barter evolved into commodity money and gave birth to market economies - For a commodity or currency to be recognized as money, 

it must be fungible, stable, recognizeable, portable, durable, divisible, uniform, with a limited supply, and acceptable.

Fungibility means the comoddity is replaceable or interchangable with another identical item; with no noticeable difference in quality, not impacting value 

and utility.  Money must obviously be portable, otherwise how are you supposed to transact?  You need to get payed some how right? - 

It also needs to be divisible to allow people to transact value proportionate to how valuable people think something is 

Money needs to be durable to stand the test of time and allow for the store of wealth. It must be uniform, something everyone can recognize and accept.

And most importantly Money should have a fixed supply - because it turns money into database of wealth.  I mean look at it this way - imagine all the money in the 

world is represented by this pie - what you have in your bank or pockets represents a slice of the pie - a portion of the money and wealth that exists in the world

Want to know what inflation is?  Well if money is a database - and all the money in the world can be represented by this pie - look closely 

at what happens when government prints more money - ... *music playing* ... Woah! Spooky right? Woah! Thats how inflation works - 

So now you know printing money is literally taking a slice of your pie and redistributing it. 

If the pie example didn't make sense thats ok - lets look at it another way - you understand fractions right?  Well lets pretend theres a fixed number to 

the amount of money there is in the world - lets say theres only 10 dollars in the world and you own 1 of them - one day the government decided to print

90 dollars more and now instead of owning 1/10th of all the money in the world - you now own 1/100th - and the printing never stops - and since

everyone is fighting for a larger share of the pie - thats why the price of everything rises - your dollars are loosing value - 

Currency is an instrument that functions like a common language between people that allows us transact value - In Ancient Rhome it was salt - 

For the Aztecs it was cacao beans - It was Whale Teeth in Fiji - Yak Dung in Tibet - Shells in Africa and China - 

grains, metals, ivory, rare stones, leather, fish, if it had the 5 characteristics of comoddity money someone probably used it as currency 

*****************

What value do these currencies have - if you go into a primary school you see children exchange ____ 

people invent currency when they have no other currency

north korea currency dark market

comoddities that aren't durable are a lousy store of value - bad cacao crop or huge new salt discovery can throw your currency and economy into turmoil


2500 years ago first metal coins in china and turkey - much like comoddities and very durable - sometimes coins are all thats left of civilizations

coins were objective and universal unit of account that allows people to buy goods over vasts regions and the market economy was born 

only if people trusted that the king or emperor who issued them wasn't cheating on the metal content

coins mean an authority now controls the supply of your currency - money and political power were inestrictively linked and centralized

minting coins in a steady and predictable manner allows economic growth and stability - as coins passed from people to peolpe 

people would cut pieces of metal from coin and in fact some taxation the kings were doing was taking  an eight of the coin off

taxes fund castles and military hobbies -financed military campaigns and expensive hobbies - taxes fund government - a living organism 

romans and uk

royal mints were substituting cheaper metals for silver and gold this is called debasement and europes kings made a habit of it

the currency of france was debased every 20 months for 200 years - if no one can trust the gold or silver content ofyour coins how can you trade with other countries

wushu coin in china retained value for 500 years - the solidus in constantinople lasted for 700 years 

international merchants came up with a solution - recognizing a persons debt has value that can be traded or transferred - when those IOUs came from reputable sources

they can be used as a form of money - paper money - this money was not based on hard commodities or metal but instead on someones promise to pay 

families like the miedeci in 15th century florencec acted as clearing houses for these ious

rise of banks 

but what is value? Money's value starts in the mind 

whoms value derives from indoctrination - I say indoctrination because money stopped being real in 1971 when President Nixon took

the U.S. Dollar off the Gold Standard.  These pieces of papers aren't backed by anything anymore - their value comes solely from the government

who calls it consumer purchasing power. 


For starters, most people don't even know that the federal reserve is a private institution - in other words, its not even federal

And it doesn't have any reserves either.  Its a giant ponzi scheme that will inevitably collapse one day - and the fed knows this

They're already working on the next generation of currency, when current one collapses - a new one will rise from the Ashes like a PHEONIX from the tower of babel



So what is money and Why is everything so damn expensive when I go grocery shopping!


game of chess position yourself now 


It's imperative we all learn what crypto currencies are.  As John Whacked McAfee once said "The pandoras box that has been open, you will never get that idea back in the box". <video is john mcafee crypto currency is coming is like the pandoras box>    As a matter
of fact  if you're from the U.S> here's your government telling you the same thing -  U.S. Treasurer of the United States Rosie Rios.  <play rosie rios video>  She even brags about her name being on over 90% of the U.S. Dollars in existence. Yeah those
pieces of paper we all work for, AND SHE'S TELLING YOU THIS IS THE FUTURE

Crypto is a double edge sword that can empower or enslave the population! So it is extremely important we all teach one another and learn about this incredible new technology.  All of us are playing
an important role in creating a better world.  If you want to change the world, start with yourself!  Because you are the world!  Always have an open mind!  For Scientists are nothing more
than normal individuals who are no better than you arguing about truth.  Humans are but biological robots nature gave rise to, we're all a bunch of smart robots with different data sets.  And truth exists, its math! And math doesn't lie.  It can't, it has no emotions.  So before we even tackle what crypto currencies are, we must first learn what money is to begin with.  You can't appreciate crypto currencies until you see the flaws of the current financial system of the world, once you see the flaws in the dollar, 
theres no going back! You're going to be flocking to liquidate everything to stack crypto like all the enligthen nerds.  

So what is money? 
Money is just a database of value, its a technology! We use it to trade wealth, and to keep track of wealth.  The pieces of paper or digital numbers we see in our bank accounts are the medium of exchange we use in the database.  Money - or the medium of exchange -  has taken many shapes and forms throughout history! - For example The ancient Mayans used cacao beans—the principal ingredient in chocolate—as a currency, according to a study published in the journal Economic Anthropology!
THAT WAS THEIR MONEY!!!  And in Asia they used RICE. 
Humans eventually transitioned from trading barter to Raw Metals such as Gold and Silver, which later evolved to Coins because
who their right mind wants to be carrying around huge blocks of Metal, they're heavy as hell.  Heck didn't levi even invent the JEANS because metal was too
heavy? (the pieces of gold)  Then Those coins also transformed.  Next came fiat currencies! The pieces of paper we all know and love! Just 
kidding not love, just know and use. Okay so allow me to explain, what are these pieces of paper?  Well originally these pieces of papers
were supposed to be backed by something! Such as precious metals! Like Gold and Silver!  Ya'll know how when you travel to different countries they have
currency exchanges, or shops that exchange your dollars for their native currency?  For example if you're from the U.S. and you travel to Mexico,
and you take your pieces of paper over there, you can go to currency exchange shop that will trade your dollars for mexican pesos!  In the past, these kinds of exchanges
existed!  But for the precious metals! And that was the birth of Banks!  And you would be able to go cash out your pieces of paper
for metals and vice versa.  They even existed here in the U.S.!  As a matter of fact there used to be multiple currencies here in the U.S.!
Until the federal reserve act passed.  Back in te day, the U.S. Dollar used to be backed by Gold.  The Gold standard had its purpose!  It was important, because it instilled discipline
in government spending.  Once you remove the scarcity aspect of money, governments can fund whatever the fuck they want! And pave way for <drum roll>
inflation! It happened in Venezuela and now they're communist:) 

Ayways lets backtrack a bit.  What the hell is the dollar?  And what in the world is the federal reserve?  Well the Federal Reserve
is actually a private bank!  Owned by a private family!  Like yourself and your family! Except its not your family.  Go ahead and pause the video and meditate on that thought for a bit.  The 
word Federal is only added to create an illusion.  An illusion we all believe.  Trust me there is nothing Federal or Reserve about the
Federal Reserve.  The U.S. Dollar today is no longer backed by anything.  We Trust In GOD.  So what is the Dollar?  The Dollar is what you call
a fiat currency.  So add that new word to your mind to your vocabulary!  Fiat Currencies.  Government issued currencies are called Fiat Currencies.

After World War 2 ended, the whole world got together to set up the new world order.  Prior to World War 2, countries
would move the BIG PIECES OF METALS around the world for payments.  Holy shit that is heavy.  After World War 2 the nations of the world got together and established The Bretton Woods Agreement a system through which a fixed currency exchange rate could be created using gold as the universal standard. The agreement involved representatives from 44 nations and brought about the creation of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.  The Bretton Woods Agreement and System created a collective international currency exchange regime that lasted from the mid-1940s to the early 1970s. 
The Bretton Woods System required a currency peg to the U.S. dollar which was in turn pegged to the price of gold.
Countries agreed to the Bretton Woods Agreement because back then, the Dollar was just as good as Gold! For it was backed by gold! However the U.S. Government started printing more money than it had gold reserves to back it, countries around the world picked up on this so they started demanding for their gold back and began exchanging their dollars for gold!  


 But then in 1971 a historical event happened. President Richard Nixon declared an emergency "temporary" hault in the exchange of dollars for gold.  A Temporary hault that is still active today.  And since then the money printing machine has gone ballistic. <show fed printing money gif here>  Under the current monetary system All money is created as debt.  
The U.S. Government borrows it from the Federal Reserve - and promises to pay it back with interest. The only problem is, 
lets imagine theres only $2 dollars in the world.  Only those $2 dollars exist in the world thats it.  And lets say I loan you the only two dollars that exist in the world, and you promise to pay them back to me with interest!  cmon who are you fooling how are you going to pay me back with interest if theres only 2 dollars in existence!  Where are you going to get another dollar to pay me back the interest?


The answer is YOU CANT! You have to borrow MORE!  In order to pay back the initial loan.  Its literally a ponzi scheme because you can never pay it off.  Its a system that requires you to get deeper and deeper in to debt!

But its okay I guess, if a ponzi scheme is what it took to get humanity where it is today.  
Its okay becase A GOLDEN AGE is upon us!  And this golden will be the direct result of the adoption of DECENTRALIZED distributed ledger technologies!  So Add that word to your vocabulary too! Distributed Ledger Technology, or DLT for short.  DLT is the core technology behind Crypto Currencies.  


<left off here> 

Okay so now that we know what money is

What the hell are crypto currencies? Well first you need to stop thinking of it as simply digital money, because although it is, it is also much more than just digital money!  Its the tokenization of
of EVERYTHING.  By tokenization I mean, putting it on the Distributed Ledger.  The world runs on middle men, and crypto will wipe them out!  And don't worry thats not a bad thing.  
Infact its a VERY good thing for it'll allow people to directly transact with one another! Without the need of middle men.  We all use these middle men everyday!  Who are these middle
men i'm talking about?  Well its THE BANKS! You every time you swipe your card middle men are taking care of business.  And they take a cut of the transaction.  With crypto people will
be able to transact directly with one another withotu the need of middle men! For all trust will lie on the computers and open source programming for the world to see.  Not only that
people will be transacting much more than just money!  For example, you'll be able to tokenize your home! Put it on a distributed ledger and have it be represented by an NFT.  Add that word to your
vocabulary too, NFTs, or none fungible tokens.  NFT's will be much more than just monkey JPEGs.  They can represent your house, your car, your diploma, your ID.  
And since its all on blockchain, its you can verify authenticity! Meaning you wouldn't be able to fake or duplicate the NFT token that represents ownership of ___.(your house your jpeg).
NFT's are very a very exciting technology.  Trust me these are just the tip of the ice berge.  NFT's will also replace all the call of duty, minecraft, and fortnite skins!  Meaning
for the first time ever YOU'LL BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY OWN your digital items!  Have ya'll ever tried the virtual reality?  Virtual real estate is coming and it will be a thing!  
And to purchase all these digital items you'll require crypto currencies.  New markets will emerge!  Despite how terrible the economy might be looking right now
We'll rebound! To new all time highs of human achievement!  You'll see!  Distributed Ledger Technologies will take the world by storm!  Its like the beginning of the internet
all over again!  Because thats exactly what it is.  A whole new internet.  

So how does the technology behind crypto currencies work?  Well at its core its a distributed ledger.  So what exactly is a distributed ledger?
We humans tend to over think things.  Guys crypto isn't as complicated as you may think.  Don't lie to yourselves saying you can't understand it
You can you're just holding yourself back, change your mentality!  Nothing is impossible to learn!  For knowledge is finite.  Again what is a distributed ledger?  Well what is a ledger?
A ledger is like a book that keeps track of all transactions.  It is the database of value that I was talking about.  
Okay so what is a bank?  Open up your bank account on your phone and scroll through all your transactions.  The transactions you're scrolling through
is a digital ledger of the banks!  It is owned and controlled by the banks.  So crypto is just a bank! That ANYONE with access to the internet can access.  
The difference between a bank and a crypto currencie is that the Banks move Dollars and Crypto Currencies move Digital Assets.
Look we have smart phones, smart watches, smart cars, smart homes but no smart money?  Oh wait we do!  Its already manifested into our reality!
Its crypto! Lets get back to how it works.  Each crypto currency has its own protocol - in other words it's own way of doing things.  Since we've all heard of Bitcoin lets explore their protocol.
 


I know we've all heard the phrase "bitcoin is digital gold".  Well i'm here to tell you that Constellation Networks $DAG
is digital oil!  What do I mean by digital oil?  Well  DATA is the new oil in the digital age right?  Well $DAG is the tokenization of DATA.   






What are crypto currencies?
So you're telling me we have smart phones smart televisions smart homes smart toasters
but no smart money?
oh wait we do its ALREADY HEREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
A lot of people think its just money, and it is but its much more than just money
Its the tokenization of everything
Well what does tokenization mean? How can you tell the difference between a crypto currency and a token? 
Already these are new vocabulary words that you need to add to your mind
If you know absolutely nothing about crypto but you want to learn and want to know what the hype is all about
then 


Flaws of Money

Bitcoin

Alt Coins
Constellation is the new internet


I know a lot of people say that say "oh I wish I knew about bitcoin before it was big" 
They feel like they missed the train, That its too late to start investing
Well I'm here to remind everyone that THIS IS the beginning 
Some of the trains are still in the station but its not waiting
on anyone its going to take off when it takes off
The universe doesn't care about your thoughts feelings or emotions.  





Crypto Currenies are networks that work together to maintain a distributed ledger 
until now there had never been anything permanent about the internet.
